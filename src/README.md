## EDRIXS Fortran
<br>

##  Basic Fortran code structure
<br>
<span style="font-size: 16px;"> **Main files**: Can be generated as executables </span>

The main files that can be run in fortran:

ed_main.f90 : Computes the eigen values and eigenenergies

xas_main.f90 : Computes the XAS

rixs_main.f90 : Computes the RIXS

opavg_main.f90 : Computes the dipole operators <br> <br>

<span style="font-size: 16px;">  **Dependent files**: Contains modules and subroutines </span>

The other files are generated as binary files which be called in the main files. <br> <br> <br>



## Fortran to python

pyapi.f90: Generates dynamic/static library that can be called in
python to access the various features written in fortran.
